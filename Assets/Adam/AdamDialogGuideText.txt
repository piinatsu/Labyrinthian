Despite being the mightiest being I care not the come's and go's of mortals in this realm.
Run that by my again


However, they know not of the harsh reality that is the true existence of the Abyss.


Indulge me, state your affair for being here
Indulge me, what contingency you brought along with you being here?

Only a fool would travel aimlessly.

Well, it matters not. I concern not myself of mortal's circumstances for I am the mighty being of this realm.

Be that as it may, let this mighty one give you a fair warning: this is no place for a mere mortal to be wandering around/about and I doubt a mortal could find his way around these parts.

You'd best return whence you coming from. I could not care less for your well-being should you find yourself hurt.

Now tell me the exact circumstances on how you wound up here.

You mean to tell me you wound up here by happenstance and now you have not a single clue about how to return to your origin? 

Little one, you have not the idea of how foolish that sounded. You'd best be on your merry way away now. Begone.

......

Now, before you are gone for good, mind run that by this olde mighty one one more time?

Hmm... I see. Yes. You mean that spot past those things yonder?

Oh, my. Deary olde me. Must have been the age catching up.
I might have been a contributing factor on that chance occassion.

I surmise I shall atone for my wrongdoings.

As you can see for yourself, this god-forsaken wasteland is no place for the unprepared.



If you don't have anything to help please bug me not and go back to whence you came from.

What? This was not in the tutorial you say? Do something about it?
 
As I already told you I concern not myself with mortal's affair. Although I admit I might have played a little part for you being here now.

Well, not really my problem is it? Although it was my fault that you ended up here in the first place.

Why don't you figure it out yourself? I got more important matters to attend to you see?

.........

Fine! Let's see here, what should I come up with when I really should attend to other more important matters.

Hmm.. Plasma blaster? No, would only nudge them at best. 
Void-quantum entanglement? Nah, that would suck him dry.
Asdasd-gravity? A double-edged sword.
Wait, Void-asdasd sounds like a good idea. Two birds one stone. But... (sigh).

.........

Tell you what, best I can do is change your molecular structure to something that is resistance to those things.

Come here. Take this. You do this to first procure materials out of thin air then you do this to stabilize those mass created, then you do this to initiate matter-phasing sequence, and then inject it into you.

I find your lack of faith disturbing.

There. Now don't come looking for me again if unless you got a hold something of interest/value.

Hmm? What's my story? I don't know. It has been too long. I recall not a single vivid memory.

One thing I'm sure of was that I was not alone and it was not cold.
