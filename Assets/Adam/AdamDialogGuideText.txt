Tell me, what contingency you brought along with you being here?

Only a fool would travel with no aim

I concern not myself of mortal's business for I am the mighty being of this realm.

Despite being the mightiest being I care not the come's and go's of mortals in this realm.

You'd best go back where you coming from.

Be that as it may, this is no place for a mere mortal to be strolling around

And I doubt a mortal could find his way around these parts, considering... No, nevermind.

Now tell me where


If you don't have anything to help please bug me not and go back to whence you came from.
