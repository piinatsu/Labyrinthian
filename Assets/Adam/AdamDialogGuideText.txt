Tell me, what contingency you brought along with you being here?

Only a fool would travel with no aim

I concern not myself of mortal's business for I am the mighty being of this realm.

Despite being the mightiest being I care not the come's and go's of mortals in this realm.

You'd best go back where you coming from.

Be that as it may, this is no place for a mere mortal to be strolling around

And I doubt a mortal could find his way around these parts, considering... No, nevermind.

Now tell me where


If you don't have anything to help please bug me not and go back to whence you came from.

What? This was not in the tutorial you say? Do something about it?
 
Well, not really my problem is it? Although it was my fault that you ended up here in the first place.

Why don't you figure it out yourself? I got more important matters to attend to you see?

.........

Fine! Let's see here, what should I come up with when I really should attend to other more important matters.

Hmm.. Plasma blaster? No, would only nudge them at best. 
Void-asdasd? Nah, that would suck him dry.
Asdasd-gravity? A double-edged sword.
Wait, Void-asdasd sounds like a good idea. Two birds one stone. But... (sigh).

.........

Tell you what, best I can do is change your molecular structure to something that is resistance to those things.

Come here. Take this. You do this to first collect materials out of thin air then you do this to stabilize these mass, then you do this to initiate matter-phasing sequence, and then inject it into you.

Now don't come looking for me again if unless you got a hold something of interest.
