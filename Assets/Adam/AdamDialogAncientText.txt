Since ancient times, there exists four domains harboring all matter tangible or otherwise serving as base ground supporting our universe. Three on the outer-rim and in-between a single inverted world where all primordial energy converge and life began.

Eons passed, its resident occupants prospered and forgathered at the center of the universe forming a single collective super nation

Prospered as we were, envy and greed, the devil incarnate itself, eventually find its way corrupting pure minds, gouging out gentle minds, plaguing any decency left.
Thus, deserting our sanctuaries, separating into three technocratic war councils and waging war at each other was the only option left for us

Countless battles, endless deaths afford no more consolation. Exhausted and wasted they finally make peace. Devastated and hostile their lands has become forced them to join hands once more and consolidate they did in their ancestral homeland. 
Forming tighly-knit rounded perimeter as they go about their newly-found life as to ward away any sign of hostility

With time, nature heals itself, so do our civilization, but never to the point of our former glory. Spread out thin we lived our life to account for the poor barren land we ourselves produced. Feared the same mistakes our predecessor did, this time with no sign of any border previously laid out by them.

return to their former glory and eventually surpassed it

But alas, these prosperous and peaceful times are short lived.
Our borrowed time in this world has run out and signs of the end have showed themselves before us for now the skies are black. 
From those very skies our predecessor have lived ever since, we can hear voices. Voices of the invaders who have been waiting for our moment of weakness.
As if it's the gods' themselves enraged and fling their fury towards us demanding our atonement for we have desecrated their image and creation centuries past.

I suppose this will be our redemption and now we left this messages as warning for new generations to come so they won't have the same fate as us. Join your hands together and pave a great future for you know not of the harsh reality that is the true existence of the Abyss...
